Information about 2.14----------------------    The primary reason for this update is to give the modem drivers theroutines needed for Andy Nicholas's ZMODEM drivers. There are also severalchanges made to the actual acos kernel to add more compatibility withappleshare and modem interrupt control.    If you are not planning on running ZMODEM and also do not intend to runGBBS Pro from an appleshare file server, then this upgrade is not for YOU!.Lance Taylor-Warren
